## Cover Letter

To whom it may concern,

I am an experienced, autodidactic software developer and a people-focused team lead. I have grown to be adaptable and precise, something that I believe comes from a keen sense for what's most important to the project in front of me. And every project is different.

As the technical co-founder of Medesen I made all of the company's technical decisions. I architected both the original prototype and its eventual redesign, I was responsible for providing direction to contractors with a high degree of technical detail and balancing the project's financial and business needs with it's software design goals.

Since then I have worked successfully across an ample range of industries and tech stacks, as an individual contributor and as a manager. At Argenti, I led a team of developers to build a tax and accounting services product for a client. I was immensely thankful for the opportunity to learn from and contribute to the professional development of my team. I was also very proud of the excellent work we did to bring that client's vision into reality.

I am people-focused, driven and committed to putting my best work forward. I would perform in exemplary fashion if given the POSITION position.

Warm Regards,  
Shayden Martin
